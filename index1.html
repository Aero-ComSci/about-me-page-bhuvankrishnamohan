            <p>“Find out what you like doing best, and get someone to pay you for doing it.” – Katharine Whitehorn. This is a quote that I live and breathe by each and every day of my life. Find what I like doing best. That is my ultimate goal in life. In order to achieve that I have some smaller goals as well. I want to be able to explore 3 careers in my life to understand what I really want. How will I do that? Expose myself to different topics, clubs, and events so I can immerse myself in the real world and have a view about what I really want to do. Recently, I have realized that the medical pathway is the one for me because I enjoy helping people and learning about the body. I also feel treating sports injuries are huge challenges and I envy challenges.  </p>
            <p>In addition to my passion for the medical field, I also have a strong interest in sports. I believe that combining my love for helping people with my fascination for sports injuries will allow me to make a meaningful impact in the lives of athletes. My goal is to pursue a career as a sports medicine physician, where I can apply my knowledge and skills to diagnose and treat sports-related injuries, as well as provide athletes with the guidance and support they need to recover and excel in their respective sports. Some of my experiences that align with this include actually playing football in high school, writing a research project on sports medicine, and going through an injury myself. </p>
            <p>Some of my major accomplishments in high school include being selected  for the football team, receiving academic awards for my outstanding performance in school, and volunteering at a local sports clinic where I assisted in rehabilitation exercises for injured athletes. These experiences have strengthened my passion for sports medicine and have shown me the importance of teamwork, dedication, and continuous learning in order to succeed in this field. In the future, I plan to pursue a  degree in a field related to sports medicine to further enhance my knowledge and skills. I also aim to gain practical experience through internships and shadowing opportunities with experienced sports medicine professionals. Ultimately, my goal is to make a positive impact on the lives of athletes by providing them with the best possible care and helping them achieve their goals both on and off the field.</p>
            <p>In conclusion, my passion for the medical field and love for sports have led me to pursue a career as a sports medicine physician. I am dedicated to helping athletes recover from injuries and excel in their sports. Through my experiences in high school and my future aspirations, I am committed to continuous learning and gaining practical experience in the field of sports medicine. I am excited for the opportunity to make a positive impact on the lives of athletes and contribute to their success both on and off the field.</p>
